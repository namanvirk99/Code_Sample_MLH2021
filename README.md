Hi, I made this project during my Python Training in 2019. The project is basically a chat server which allows:

=> multiple clients to chat with each other 

=> authority to use it with valid username and password

=> Password change option is also available

=> The details of the clients with whom you are chatting can be checked

I worked on the overall development of the project including backend and frontend.
