Hi, I made this project during my Python Training in 2019. The project is basically a chat server which allows:

=> multiple clients to chat with each other 

=> authority to use it with valid username and password

=> password change option is also available

=> details of the clients with whom you are chatting can be checked

I worked on the overall development of the project including backend and frontend.

The project is divided into 3 layers:

1. Business Layer

2. Presentation Layer

3. Data Layer


I have uploaded 4 files:

Business Layer (backend): UMS_Services and loginservices

Presentation Layer (frontend): login and mainframes
